# Custom Replay Tool for Unity
A Unity package for recording, saving, and replaying physics-based gameplay.

Records Rigidbody transformations at configurable frequencies, with higher precision for player objects. (Though I think this is currently bugged)

Provides an editor window for easy recording management and visualization of replays.
